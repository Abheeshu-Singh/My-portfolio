          From the moment I was able to finish my first project, I knew I was
          hooked into the world of apps development. APP development has never
          been "just a passion" for me.It has offered an engaging challenge to
          continuously learn and improve my skills in creating better Mobile Apps.
          I used flutter to develop apps in iOS and Android.
        </p>

          What started with just a curiosity of building something has become a
          full-fledged passion that only makes me more interested as the years
          go by.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a motivated developer with skills in Flutter, Dart, API fetching, Firebase, UI designs.
